        <h2 class = "delay-1s slideInLeft animated"> Bamboo </h2>
        <p1 class = "delay-2s fadeIn animated"> Pandas are known for eating bamboo all day; more specifically 16 to 24 hours a day. It is not surprising as 99%
            of
            their diet is bamboo. Bamboo became their official diet as far back as three million years ago. However, their
            carnivorous digestive system makes it difficult to digest the needed nutrients needed as bamboo is mostly
            composed
            of cellulose. As a result, they eat a great amount of grass to make up for this loss. During spring, the pandas
            would eat young wood bamboo shoots which have phosphorus and nitrogen. In June, the pandas migrate to higher
            elevations to eat young arrow bamboo shoots to obtain a sufficient amount of calcium.

        <h2 class = "delay-1s slideInLeft animated"> Meat and Calcium </h2>
        <p1 class = "delay-2s fadeIn animated"> Pandas are bears, like other bears they have a digestive system that is meant to break down meat. However,
            since 99% of their diet is bamboo they lack a lot of nutrients, especially calcium. Pandas would not be able to
            survive outside of their habitat. Sometimes, pandas resort to licking rocks to gain the calcium needed to
            survive. Their diet has played a main part in why they are endangered, they simply lack the nutrients needed to
            survive.
