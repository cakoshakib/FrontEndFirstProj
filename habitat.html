    <p1 class = "delay-2s fadeIn animated">The homes of these furry giants is central China, where they reside in the mountain ranges of Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces. They live in broadleaf and coniferous forests that supplies them with their bamboo, a plant essential to their diet. These forests are also often times misty and torrential rainfall is not uncommon. Pandas can also be found in zoos and breeding centers located around the world.</p1>
    <h2 class = "delay-1s slideInLeft animated">Bye, Bye Home! </h2>
    <p1 class = "delay-2s fadeIn animated">Although pandas are located in zoos and many of them still reside in their natural environment, the truth is that they once lived in the lowland areas of central China and had a much larger population. As time went by, pandas were forced higher and higher up the mountains to escape the consequences of deforestation and farming that undoubtedly threatened their existence. Pandas are currently titled as a “vulnerable” species, and there are as many as 1,864 giant pandas in the wild.</p1>
