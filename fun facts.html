        <h1 class = "fadeIn animated">Fun Facts about Pandas</h1>
        <p1 class = "fadeIn animated">Along with how adorable they look, pandas are also very intriguing animals! Here are 15 fun facts about pandas</p1>

        <h2 class = "delay-1s slideInLeft animated">1. Pandas have been around for a pretty long time</h2>
        <p1 class = "delay-2s fadeIn animated">
            Pandas are orignally from Southwestern China, and have been around since the Han Dynasty (from 206 AD to 24 AD). They were the emperors' favorite animals, and many believed they even had mystical
            powers! However, they were not known by the world until 1869, when Pere Armand David, a French missionary and naturalist, was the first Westerner to describe a panda to the world. The first panda came to the
            United States in 1972, when Richard Nixon and the first lady went to visit China, and received one as a gift to put in the National Zoo, located in Washington DC. In China, the panda is still respected by many, and
            is labeled as China's "National Treasure".

        <h2 class = "delay-1s slideInLeft animated">2. Pandas are very chubby</H2>
        <p1 class = "delay-2s fadeIn animated">Pandas, or "Ailuropoda melanoleuca", can weigh up to 353 pounds, and have an average height of 4-5 feet. They love bamboo, and can eat from 25 to 40 pounds of bamboo per day. Pandas can survive a maximum of 20 years in the wild, but a maximum of 35 years in captivity. In appearance, pandas are white with black markings. No two pandas have the same balck markings on their face. To the human eye, they look the same, but minor differences are present. </p1>

        <h2 class = "delay-1s slideInLeft animated">3. Pandas have interesting habits</h2>
        <p1 class = "delay-2s fadeIn animated">Pandas, although cute, have different characteristics. For example, they mark their territories by rubbing themselves against trees. They also have six toes! They extra toe helps them hold and make the bamboo easier to eat. They also have a strange addiction to metals, and enjoy licking copper and iron pots.</p1>

        <h2 class = "delay-1s slideInLeft animated">4.Panda babies are small</h2>
        <p1 class = "delay-2s fadeIn animated">When pandas are born (Usually in August), they are nothing compared to the humongous, teddy bear-like pandas we generally know of. They are pink in color, and weigh 1/900 of their mother. Panda babies are literally the size of a stick of butter when they are born! They usually do not turn black and white until they are three weeks old</p1>

        <h2 class = "delay-1s slideInLeft animated">5. Pandas have a good life </h2>
        <p1 class = "delay-2s fadeIn animated"> Pandas are easily the most lazy animals, maybe besides a sloth. They literally do nothing except eat bamboo (or leaves, or whatever they like), and sleep, mostly doing physical action in the mornings. When they are active, pandas love to play, climb trees, and swim.</p1>
